## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

x <- c(1:100)
y <- list()

for (i in x) {
  y <- append(sin(x),0)
}

data <- data.frame(x=x, y=y[1:length(x)])

ggplot(data, aes(x=x, y=y)) + 
geom_line() + 
theme_classic()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
